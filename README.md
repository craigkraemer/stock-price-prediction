Created a sample dataset with days and stock prices.
Used pandas to organize and print the data.
Trained a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
Predicted the price of Bitcoin for Day 10 on August 15, 2025 based on earlier patterns. The prediction was only off by 4.5%.

What I learned:

How to structure and explore data with pandas.
How to train a simple machine learning model and make predictions.
How data science tools can be used for real-life forecasting.
